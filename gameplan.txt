INCOMPLETE

You wake up, confused, and find yourself in a dimly lit hallway...
| Go Left.
	You walk left and stop abruptly after hearing a creaking noise from above...
		| Hit the suspicious red button you see next to you.
			The floor disappears below you, and you start to fall. At least the walls won't hurt you...
			You think it's been about 2 hours since you started falling, when, to your surprise, you start floating upwards. It's as if... you can fly!
			| Attempt to fly back up.
			| Float to the bottom of the hole. 
| Go Right.
	You go right to find a dead end and an array of switches, but there are no lightbulbs. Only candles...
	| Flip the switches.
		You flip two switches, and a door opens up behind you. You flip the other two, and another one opens in front of you! Either one could get you out, or to Oblivion.
		| Enter Door 2
	| Walk towards the candles.
		You walk towards the candles and find 23 of them, and a few matches. Only 18 candles are lit up...
		| Light the remainder of the candles.
-----------------------------
| Trust your instincts and climb faster.
	You reach the top of the ladder, barely. You see a lit up staircase to your left...
	| Climb the staircase.
		You sprint up the staircase, and almost fall over when you reach the end. A bottomless pit... Well, almost. You see a small light shining at the very bottom of the pit... Your way out? Possibly...
		| Jump in!
		| Turn back.
			You turn back only to find that your path has been blocked! A passage opens up to your left...
			| Jump in.
			| Go left.
